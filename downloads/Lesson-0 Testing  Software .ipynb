This is the third summer school on data science following the previous ones held at Makere in Kampala in 2016 and Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in 2015.\n",

    "To ensure we hit the ground running, it is essential you install the prerequiste software and test it out and make sure it is working on your computer. The venue for the summer school will have some computers on which the software will have been installed but you are advised to come with your own laptop with the software installed. \n",

You can download the various versions of the software for your laptop OS and architecture from the [Anaconda website](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Please download **python 3.x**, the notebooks may not work with python 2!"

    "[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) is a Python library that is particularly good for doing any data-related tasks in Python. We will use several other libraries in Python as well. You are adviced to go through the [scipy-lectures (sections 1.1 - 1.4 and 3.1)](http://www.scipy-lectures.org) to get a good grounding in the libraries we will be using.\n",

    "To test that everything is working fine:\n",
    "1. Go to the website and download the [Production of major crops by district, UCA 2008 / 2009](http://catalog.data.ug/dataset/production-of-major-crops-by-district-uca-2008-2009) data. It includes excel sheets for the 4 regions of Uganda detailing in each production figures for major crops.\n",
    "2. Use Pandas to read in the first sheet of data from the excel document as shown below\n",
    "3. Work through some of the example analyses shown and complete the questions that follow.\n",
    "4. Go get a cold beer, drink 3/4 of it and inform a friend that you are now ready for the data science summer school 2017 !"
